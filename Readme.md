# k-mediod Implementation
## A Implementation of one the clustering algorithms called k-mediod.

*************************************
### *Description*: 

*To study and illustrate the working of clustering algorithms.*

A assignment for Data Warehouse and Data Mining course in B.E. Computer Science Course.
```
1. The k-medoids algorithm is a clustering approach related to k-means clustering for partitioning a data set into k groups or clusters.
2. In k-medoids clustering, each cluster is represented by one of the data point in the cluster.
3. These points are named cluster medoids.
4. k-medoid is a robust alternative to k-means clustering.
5. The algorithm is less sensitive to noise and outliers, compared to k-means.

*****************************************
### *Technology stack*:

Java, Netbeans 
*****************************************

### *Key functionality*: 
```
1. Number of mediods can be changed as per required.
2. Size of dataset can be user defined.
3. File input is provided to insert dataset.
4. Initial and Final cost is displayed.
```
**************************************

### *Running the code*:

```
1. Download the repository.
2. Open Netbeans IDE and go to Files menu and Select Import Project.
3. Choose "Import from ZIP", and search for the location where you saved the downloaded ZIP folder.
4. Select the folder and let it load.
5. Create a dataset file at particular location.
6. Open the Run Package and run the file kmediod.java using "Shift+F6".
7. Explore the other packages (Commands, Utilities, structuerview, structure) for code and more details.
